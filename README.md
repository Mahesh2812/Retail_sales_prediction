Retail Sales Prediction Report

1. Introduction
Purpose: This report details the steps taken to predict retail sales using historical data. Accurate sales forecasting is essential for optimizing inventory and planning marketing strategies.

2. Dataset
Description: The dataset includes sales and store-related information. Key columns include Sales, StoreType, Customers, CompetitionDistance, and others.

3. Data Processing
Loaded Data: Imported the dataset for analysis.
Info: Reviewed dataset structure, data types, and non-null counts.
Head/Tail: Displayed the first and last few rows to understand data distribution and check for anomalies.
Describe: Generated summary statistics to get a sense of data ranges and distributions.
Handled Null Values: Addressed missing values through imputation or removal.
Handled Outliers: Identified and managed outliers to avoid skewing results.

4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Distribution Plot: Plotted distribution of key variables to understand their spread and identify any skewness.
Merged Sales and Store Data: Combined sales data with store data for a comprehensive analysis.
Categorical Column List: Created a list of categorical columns for further analysis.
Categorical Variable Analysis: Iterated over categorical variables and plotted their distributions.
Store Open and Days: Analyzed the relationship between store opening status and days of the week.
Store Type and Assortment Levels: Investigated the impact of store type and assortment levels on sales.
Grouped Sales by StoreType: Aggregated sales and customer counts by store type.
Explored Store Type Influence: Examined how different store types affect sales.
Monthly Sales: Analyzed sales trends over different months.
Scatterplots: Created scatterplots to explore relationships between Customers and Sales, and CompetitionDistance and Sales.
Correlation Matrix: Calculated correlations between numerical features to identify significant relationships.
Outliers Distribution: Visualized outliers to understand their impact on the dataset.
Store Type and Day of Week: Explored how store type affects sales on different days of the week.

5. Feature Engineering and Model Building
Sliced Recent Data: Focused on the most recent six weeks for model training and testing.
Train/Test Split: Created training and testing sets for machine learning models.
Feature and Target Split: Separated features (X) and target variable (y) for both training and testing sets.
Fit Encoder: Applied encoding techniques to categorical variables.
Standard Scaler: Used StandardScaler for feature scaling.

Model Training:
Decision Tree Regressor: Trained a decision tree model to predict sales.
Model Evaluation:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Measured the average absolute error between predicted and actual values.
Mean Squared Error (MSE): Assessed the average squared error to evaluate model performance.
R-squared: Calculated the coefficient of determination to understand the proportion of variance explained by the model.

6. Conclusion
Summary: The analysis provided insights into sales trends, store performance, and the impact of various factors on sales.
Implications: Findings can help optimize inventory management and marketing strategies.
Future Work: Consider incorporating additional features or exploring other modeling techniques to improve prediction accuracy.

7. Code and Data
Repository: Code and dataset available in the GitHub repository.
Dependencies: List of required libraries and packages.
